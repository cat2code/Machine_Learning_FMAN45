# Machine_Learning_FMAN45

A course at LTH in Machine Learning methods in various fields [course code FMSN50]. Feel free to use as inspiration but I condone blatant plagiarism. The course examination consists of a series of hand-ins and a final examination where I made a presentation covering a modern paper in the field of ML, namely visual transformers in the paper "An image is worth 16x16 words" released by Google research Brain team.
